<h1>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h1>





<p>
Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

<h1>Where does it come from?</h1>

Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

<h1>Ancient Egypt - THE Pharoah</h1>
<p>
The Pharoah was a living god.  He was at the top of Ancient Egyptian society.  The pharoah
was responsible for the well being of his people and was obligated to keep the order. 
He was all powerful and he spent most of his time at the capital city of Memphis.  Here 
he administered control of both Lower and Upper Egypt.
</p>

<h1>The Tombs of the Pharoahs</h1>
<p>
The Pharoah spent most of his life working on his tomb.  The Pharoah's had this busy afterlife
where they continued to control the universe after their death.  The god Anubis assisted
the pharoah in the mummfication process.  After the pharoah died he traveled to the underworld
using the Book of the Dead.
